# Markdown to HTML CLI

## Mini project 1! 

The goal of this project is to create a simple Node.js program that reads a .md file and saves it as HTML. By doing that I'm focusing on learning how to use:
* fs
* process.argv 

Note: I am implementing the basic syntax from the [Markdown guide org](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), and I'm not taking into consideration alternative syntaxes
